After attending, learners will be able to:

* Explain and differentiate key terms, phrases, and concepts associated with AI and Machine Learning in GLAM
* Describe ways in which AI is being innovatively used in the cultural heritage context today
* Identify what kinds of tasks machine learning models excel at in GLAM applications
* Identify weaknesses in machine learning models
* Reflect on ethical implications of applying machine learning to cultural heritage collections and discuss potential mitigation strategies
* Summarise the practical, technical steps involved in undertaking machine learning projects
* Identify additional resources on AI and Machine Learning in GLAM
